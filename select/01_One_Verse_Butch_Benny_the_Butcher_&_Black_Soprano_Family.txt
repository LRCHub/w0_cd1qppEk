Ah, ah, big Butch'
The Butcher comin', nigga
Summertime Butch'
Ayo, niggas', let's load up
Yeah, ayo

Yo, tell me this
Why would y'all even assume
That these niggas is a threat?
Why would y'all even assume
That these niggas is ready for this type of shit?
Ah, The Butcher comin' nigga
Yo, Big Butchie' (Ah)

A lot of y'all don't got the right to speak
Your money short, your ice look weak (Shit look weak)
This a different type of beef
I sent hits twice this week (Hahaha), you triflin' me?
Even gavе my bitch a jack, so my wife can eat
(So she can еat)
That's right, nigga, I really gave her smack
But ain't no Ike in me, the fight in me like Holyfield
The competition biting me (Damn), you know it's real
I fed niggas anyway, I guess that's life for me (That's life)
That's light for me (Ah)
And I really do this shit
It ain't no hype in me (Nigga)
Gotta think that through
The price for you ain't the price for me
Seen dope money, seen legal cake
New money and RICO cake
When I open up them bills
That shit look like Al Pacino face
Them 308 rifle shells
They move at a torpedo pace
The opps got to relocate
We get that bitch too
You think she so safe (Hold on)
DOA, Butch' gonna bring them racks to you
Like BOA
Ankle monitor, further soccer goal
A hundred feet away
But check it
Why wait for them streams to pay
When I'm a triple beam away
From lockin' everything away and throwin' the keys away?
That's gangster, every ship need an anchor (They do)
Had the trap in South Buff', the licks came from Salamanca (They did)
No thank you, but I'm a soccer Dad now
I told my baby, "Call me Pops"
I had to babysit these blocks
Push my Mercedes Benz in Crocs
One verse Butch', nigga, let's go (Ah, hahaha)

One verse Butch, right?
(Black Soprano Family)
'Cause niggas really don't deserve another verse (Uh-huh)
'Cause y'all be listenin' to that other shit
(Big Mob)
Y'all be jackin' that other shit (Big BSF)
And that shit don't hit like this
(Everything Eastside Buffalo)
Huh, we real street niggas, we stand on that
(Five to fifty)
Besides that, we businessmen, nigga
Niggas take care of they family, nigga
(Too many stripes on my niggas)
Put the team on, move my mama out the hood
Nigga
Talk about somethin' real
(Too many generals in this bitch)
Summertime Butch', nigga, ah (Yeah)
Summertime Butch'
